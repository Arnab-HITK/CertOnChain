# CertOnChain 🎓🔗

CertOnChain is a decentralized web application (DApp) for issuing and verifying academic certificates using blockchain technology. Built with Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS storage, and SHA-256 hashing, it ensures certificate authenticity and prevents forgery.

## 🔍 Features

- Issue academic certificates and store metadata on the blockchain
- Verify certificates by comparing uploaded files with blockchain records
- Secure and transparent using Ethereum smart contracts
- Integrated with MetaMask for decentralized identity
- Certificate files are stored on IPFS
- Supports SHA-256 hashing for file integrity

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Solidity** – Smart contract development  
- **Web3.js** – Blockchain interaction  
- **IPFS** – Decentralized certificate file storage  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Frontend  
- **Ganache** – Local Ethereum blockchain  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet authentication

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Admin Login** via MetaMask
2. **Upload Certificate** and input metadata (Name, Course, Issue Date)
3. **Generate SHA-256 Hash** of the certificate
4. **Upload File to IPFS** and store hash + metadata on blockchain
5. **Verifier Portal** allows users to upload a certificate and verify it against the stored hash
